# Contributing to the W3C Process Document
Thank-you for offering to contribute to the [W3C Process Document](https://www.w3.org/2017/Process-20170301/). Here we provide some details on how you can contribute. 

Changes to the process document tend to fall into a few classes, and how the W3C handles these varies. Simple editorial changes may require little review, but more substantial changes will require a more substantial review and discussions by the W3C community. Please read the below, and get involved as explained. 

If you have any questions, please [raise an issue](/w3c/w3process/issues).

## Simple Editorial Changes
For simple editorial changes, please feel free to raise a `pull request` or [raise an issue](/w3c/w3process/issues) on this repository. A simple editorial change can be things like spelling and grammar mistakes, broken links, and so on.

Some changes may appear simple but may actually be more complicated than they appear. Don't worry - please continue to send your `pull request` or [raise an issue](/w3c/w3process/issues) and we can discuss. 

## Changes that Affect the Way the W3C Operates
for changes that affect the way that the W3C operates but that don't change policy, raise it as an issue here and get it on the agenda of the Process CG to explain why you think this is an improvement to the operation of the W3C. It's probably not helpful to provide a Pull Request until you have consensus on the approach.
For changes that represent a change of policy in the W3C, bring the idea first to the Advisory Board or Advisory Committee. Again, a Pull Request can wait until you have consensus.
Pull Requests should result in a correct-looking document (formats and lays out correctly).

(Why doesn't a PR help me by telling me where I can view the result of accepting it...?)
